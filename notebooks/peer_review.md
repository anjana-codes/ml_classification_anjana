# Peer Review: Beaderstadt UCI Mushroom Dataset: Classification Machine Learning Midterm

**Notebook Link:** 
[Beaderstadt Mushroom Classification Notebook](https://github.com/username/repo/blob/main/mushroom_classification.ipynb)

## 1. Clarity & Organization
The notebook is exceptionally well-structured and easy to follow. Each section flows logically from data import and exploration to feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. Visualizations are clear and enhance understanding of the data patterns and model results.

## 2. Feature Selection & Justification
The selected features (`odor`, `gill-color`, `cap-shape`, `bruises`, `spore-print-color`, and `cap-color-group`) are thoughtfully chosen based on exploratory analysis. The rationale for including both raw and engineered features is clearly explained, demonstrating a strong understanding of feature importance in classification.

## 3. Model Performance & Comparisons
Model evaluation is thorough and well-presented, with detailed metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score) for both Decision Tree and Random Forest. Confusion matrices and feature importance plots effectively communicate the strengths of the models. The high accuracy on both training and test sets shows excellent model performance.

## 4. Reflection Quality
Reflections are insightful, highlighting key findings such as the dominance of `odor` as a predictor and the effectiveness of tree-based models. The author demonstrates a clear understanding of the data, modeling process, and results interpretation.

**Overall:** This notebook is highly professional, well-documented, and demonstrates strong analytical and modeling skills. Awesome work!
